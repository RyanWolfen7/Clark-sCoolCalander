# Clarks Cool Calander

## Overview

    This was my first attempt to make a calander app. I am using only one npm and react, the rest of the project is vanilla. I have only had fleet time to prepare this and there are many features I'd like to add given the time. I have already spent a while on this and my GF is missing me ^.^

    Future Plans:
    - implimenting Redux Thunk
    - add slide animation for the calander where a dog pulls it into view
    - better validation
    - rework the components
    - better structure the css
